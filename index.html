    <section id="about">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I’m currently a senior Data Science student at the University of Oregon, where I’m building a strong foundation in data analysis, machine learning, and deep learning. My academic journey has been deeply focused on applying data-driven techniques to real-world problems, with a particular interest in sports science. I’m passionate about uncovering insights that drive better performance, especially when it comes to understanding the biomechanics of athletes and improving training methodologies. My work combines both theory and practical application, and I’m always eager to explore new ways to push the boundaries of what data science can achieve.</p>

        <p>Alongside my academic work, I’ve been actively conducting research in deep learning, applying autoencoders to understand patterns in force curves and athlete movements. I’m also focused on sports analytics, specifically how training and recovery influence athletic performance over time. With a strong analytical mindset, I aim to bridge the gap between sports science and advanced AI techniques. Ultimately, I strive to contribute to a more data-driven approach to athletic development, and I’m excited by the potential impact of this research on the future of sports science and performance optimization.</p>

            <h4>Project Synopsis</h4>
            <p>This project explores the use of autoencoders to analyze the consistency of athletes' jumps, focusing on the force-time curves during the jump cycle. Autoencoders, a type of neural network, were applied to identify patterns in force application over time. The primary goal was to normalize jump data based on the moment of takeoff (when force is zero), making it possible to compare jumps across different trials more effectively. Additionally, reconstructed jump profiles were analyzed to assess jump quality and identify potential areas for improvement in an athlete’s performance. The project also aims to link this data-driven analysis with improved training methodologies, potentially guiding better training and recovery strategies for athletes.</p>
